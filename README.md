# Go Cassandra Example
## Description
This project is a simple example of using Go with Apache Cassandra to manage and analyze data.   
It demonstrates how to connect to a Cassandra cluster, create a keyspace and table, insert sample sleep data, and perform basic queries to calculate average sleep time.
